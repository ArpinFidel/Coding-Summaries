1. GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR (Faktor Persekutuan Terbesar) :

for b >= a,

	int gcd (int a, int b) {
		if (a == 0) return b;
		return gcd (b % a, a);
	}

also, to find the LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE
LCM (a, b) = a * b / GCD (a, b)




2. PRIME SIEVE :

2.A. SIMPLE SIEVE

The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the oldest ways to find prime numbers, and is still one of the fastest. It does so by marking the multiples of each prime, starting from 2. When all the multiples of that number (up to a given limit) has been marked, the first unmarked numbers has to be a prime. This prime is then used to find more primes.



2.B. OPTIMISATIONS

2.B.1. SQUARE ROOT
A number cannot have more than one factor larger than its root. This means that to mark all numbers up to N, we only have to look for primes up to sqrt(N) (this concept will be important later on). We can also start marking numbers from the square of the prime instead of its first multiple (2 * P).

2.B.2. MULTIPLES OF 2
Since we know that the first prime is 2, we can cut the time required to compute the sieve by half by simply ignoring all the multiples of two.



2.C IMPLEMENTATION

// true is false

2.C.1. BASIC SIEVE

	void esieve (int n) {
	
		memset (isprime, 0, n);
		
		isprime[0] = isprime[1] = true;

		for (int i = 4; i <= n; i += 2) isprime[i] = true;

		for (int i = 3; i * i < n; i += 2)
			if (isprime[i] == false)
				for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
					isprime[j] = true;
	}


2.C.2. SLOWER BUT SIMPLER VARIATION

	// not optimised. optimisation left as exercise for the reader
	void sieve (int n) {
	
		memset (isprime, 0, n);
		
		for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
		
			if (!isprime[i]) primelist.push_back (i);
			
			for (int j = 0; j < p.size() && i * primelist[j] <= n; j++) {
			
				isprime[i * primelist[j]] = true;
				if (i % primelist[j] == 0) break;
			}
		}
	}
	
	
2.C.3. OVERLY OPTIMISED VARIATION
	void esieve (int n) {
		
		memset (isprime, 0, n / 2);
	
		for (int i = 3; i * i < n; i += 2)
			if (sieve[(i - 3) / 2] == false)
				for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i * 2)
					sieve[(j - 3) / 2] = true;
	}
	
	


2.D. SEGMENTED SIEVE

The segmented sieve is used for cases where only some of the primes are needed. It works the same way as the simple sieve, utilising the square root concept.

	1. We start with two numbers L and U. To mark all the numbers up to U, we need to have all the primes below sqrt(U). Simply use the simple sieve for this.
	
	2. For each prime P from 2 to sqrt(U) :
		2.1 find the first multiple of P after L
		2.2 mark all multiples of P between L and U as not prime
		


2.E. IMPLEMENTATION

	void ssieve (unsigned long long L, unsigned long long U) {
	
		memset (isprime, 0, U - L + 1);
		
		int l;

		for (int i = 0 ; i < primectr ; i++) {
			if (primelist[i] == 0) continue;

			l = L / primelist[i] * primelist[i];

			if (L % primelist[i] != 0) l += primelist[i];

			if (l <= primelist[i]) l += primelist[i];

			for (unsigned long j = l ; j <= U ; j += primelist[i]) {
				isprime[j - L] = true;
			}
		}
	}
